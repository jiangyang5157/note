# Kotlin & Java

# Kotlin
- Clean syntex
    - var/val/fun, String template, lambda, forEach, filter, asXXX, ranges, iterator, lazy, override operator, null check, etc.
    - Easy to learn
- Extension
- data/open class
- Compatible with Jave
- inline: func code will be copied into all called places.
    - Good: replace default push/pop func stack, save some runtime memory/performance
    - Bad: after compiled, code expended and takes more memory spaces
    - Usage: often called func
    - reified
        - For: is, as, T::class, etc usage

# Java
- a ? b : c
