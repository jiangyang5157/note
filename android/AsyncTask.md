# AsyncTask

It is a light-weight asynchronous class (Params, Progress, Result).
- Threadpool: SerialExecutor + THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR
    - Default thread pool size is 5, cache is 10
- 1 Handler(static InternalHandler requires to be loaded in MainThread)
- Abstract Class
    - MainThread: onPreExecute()
    - ThreadPool: doInBackground(Params... params)
    - publishProgress -> onProgressUpdate
    - MainThread: onProgressUpdate(Progress... values)
    - MainThread: onPostExecute(Result result)
    - MainThread: onCancelled()

Cancell
- Not actual cancell the task, but setting status to cancel, we can check status in doInBackground(). Just like interrupt() a Thread, we can check in the thread to end itself.
- When cancel(), onCancelled() called, and onPostExecute() won't be call.

Advantage
- Easy update UI, instead of passing value to MainThread Handler.

Disadvantage
- AsyncTask doesn't bind with any component's lifecycle (eg: cancel(boolean) it when Activity/Fragment destory.
- AsyncTask has to be created in MainThread.
- AsyncTask.execute() has to be invoked in MainThread, and only call once.
- Memory leak
    - If a AsyncTask is a non-static inner class within Activityï¼Œthen it will keep a reference of creator Activity. When the Activity destoryed before the Asynctack completed, the Activity reference will be kept in the memory. As a result, creator Activity won't be recycled by GC, and it leads to a memory leak.

Activity OnConfiguration
- EventBus post a AsyncTaskResultEvent(result)
